## What is Insiders?

Material for MkDocs Insiders is a private fork of Material for MkDocs, hosted as
a private GitHub repository. Almost[^1] [all new features][what's in it for you]
are developed as part of this fork, which means that they are immediately
available to all eligible sponsors, as they are made collaborators of this
repository.

  [^1]:
    In general, every new feature is first exclusively released to sponsors, but
    sometimes upstream dependencies like [Python Markdown Extensions] enhance
    existing features that must be supported by Material for MkDocs.

Sponsorships start as low as [__$15 a month__][how to become a sponsor].[^2]

  [^2]:
    Note that $15 a month is the minimum amount to become eligible for
    Insiders. While GitHub Sponsors also allows to sponsor lower amounts or
    one-time amounts, those can't be granted access to Insiders due to
    technical reasons.
