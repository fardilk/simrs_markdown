## What sponsorships achieve

Sponsorships make this project sustainable, as they buy the maintainers of this
project time – a very scarce resource – which is spent on the development of new
features, bug fixing, stability improvement, issue triage and general support.
The biggest bottleneck in Open Source is time.[^3]

  [^3]:
    Making an Open Source project sustainable is exceptionally hard: maintainers
    burn out, projects are abandoned. That's not great and very unpredictable.
    The sponsorware model ensures that if you decide to use Material for MkDocs,
    you can be sure that bugs are fixed quickly and new features are added
    regularly.

If you're unsure if you should sponsor this project, check out the list of
[completed funding goals] to learn whether you're already using features that
were developed with the help of sponsorships. You're most likely using at least
a handful of them, [thanks to our awesome sponsors]!
